# Python Greeting Script

This Python script greets the user based on the time of day when a new terminal session is opened.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/prasiddha98/greet_terminal.git
   cd greet_terminal
   ```

2. Make the script executable (if necessary):
   ```
   chmod +x greet.py
   ```

## Usage

To greet the user automatically when opening a new terminal session, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
python3 /path/to/greet.py
```

Replace `/path/to/greet.py` with the actual path where you've saved the `greet.py` script.
